A throttler for Akka 2.0
========================

What is this about?
--------------------

A typical usage scenario for a throttler is this: your application needs to make calls to an external webservice and this webservice has a restriction in place. You may only make _X_ calls in _Y_ seconds. You get blocked or need to pay gold if you don't stay under this limit. With a throttler, you can ensure that the calls you make do not cross the threshold rate.

You create a throttler by specifying a _rate_, for example `3 msgsPer (1 second)` and a _target actor_. You can then send the throttler messages at any rate, and the throttler will send the messages to the target at a rate at most 3 msg/s.

Example
-------

```scala
// A simple actor that prints whatever it receives
val printer = system.actorOf(Props(new Actor {
  def receive = {
    case x => println(x)
  }
}))

// The throttler for this example
val throttler = system.actorOf(Props[TimerBasedThrottler])

// Set the target and rate
throttler ! SetTarget(Some(printer))
throttler ! SetRate(3 msgsPer (1 second))

// These three messages will be sent to the printer immediately
throttler ! Queue("1")
throttler ! Queue("2")
throttler ! Queue("3")

// These two will wait at least until 1 second has passed
throttler ! Queue("4")
throttler ! Queue("5")
```

Status
------
Take a look at the [API][3] to see what is provided. Most of the functionality is documented [here][7] and "described" in the [tests][6]. To run them, check out the code and do a `sbt test`.

Currently, the project only provides a timer-based implementation of a throttler, see [TimerBasedThrottler][2]. As [described][2] in the class documentation, this throttler only provides weak guarantees.

There are plans to add an implementation of a history-based throttler that provides stronger guarantees, like for example the [one][4] by Charles Cordingley.
